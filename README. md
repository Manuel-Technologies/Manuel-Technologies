#  Hello, I'm **Manuel** 🇳🇬👋

**Full-stack .NET developer who ships production apps straight from an Android phone** 💻❌📱⚙️  
I turned mobile development into a lifestyle since 2025.

### What I build
- Production backends using **.NET 8 Minimal APIs**  
- Cross-platform apps with **MAUI** (Android and Windows)  
- IoT and embedded systems with ESP32, sensors and C# firmware  
- Smart contracts and developer tools on the **Sui Blockchain** using **Move**  
- Real student-focused products used daily in local campuses

### What I'm working on now
- **CampusStay** – A simple and verified way for Nigerian students to find hostels 🏠  
- Several Move language projects on Sui  
- Constant C# experiments and open source drops

### My tech stack
`.NET 8` `C# 12` `MAUI` `EF Core`  
`SQLite` `PostgreSQL` `Minimal APIs`  
`SignalR` `gRPC` `Bluetooth LE` `MQTT`  
`Sui/Move` `Rust (light)`  
`Termux` `a-Shell`

### Tools I use daily

- No excuses, just consistent shipping
