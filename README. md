# Hello, I'm Manuel 🇳🇬 👋

**Full-stack .NET developer who ships production apps straight from an Android phone** 💻❌📱⚙️

I turned mobile development into a lifestyle since 2025.

## What I Build
- Production backends using **.NET 8 Minimal APIs**
- Cross-platform apps with **MAUI** (Android and Windows)
- IoT and embedded systems with ESP32, sensors and C# firmware
- Smart contracts and developer tools on the **Sui Blockchain** using **Move**
- Real student-focused products used daily in local campuses

## What I'm Working On Now
- **CampusStay** – A simple and verified way for Nigerian students to find hostels 🏠
- Several Move language projects on Sui
- Constant C# experiments and open source drops

## My Tech Stack
`.NET 8` • `C# 12` • `MAUI` • `EF Core` • `SQLite` • `PostgreSQL` • `Minimal APIs` • `SignalR` • `gRPC` • `Bluetooth LE` • `MQTT` • `Sui/Move` • `Rust`

## Tools I Use Daily
- Android phone (Tecno), Termux and a-Shell
- Neovim configured for full development
- Git directly from mobile with CI/CD on GitHub Actions
- No excuses, just consistent shipping
